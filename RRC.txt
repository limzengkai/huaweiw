RRC
----
-> The major role of RRC is to control(configure) all the Radio Resources (PHY, MAC, RLC, PDCP) to make it possible 
   to communicate between UE and the base station (e.g, gNB, eNB, NB, BTS etc).
RRC messages are used as signalling between UE and Base station.
	-> can be used to encapsulate NAS messages for their transfer between UE and eNodeB
NAS(Non Access Stratum) messages are used as signalling between UE and MME.
----

We need to form SRB to have a tunnel to transfer DRB
SRB0: Used for initial access,RRC connetion establishment
[RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel]
CCCH(Common Control Channel): for transmitting control information between UEs and network.
			      used for UEs having no RRC connection with the network.
SRB1: for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as 
	for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;
[传输的数据比较可靠些，大多数的数据都是走srb1，除非sbr1命令去sbr0]
SRB2: for NAS messages, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower-priority 
	than SRB1 and is always configured by the network after security activation;
SRB : NAS -> RRC -> PDCP -> RLC -> MAC -> PHY
【每个UE内设的SIM卡然后这个卡是在运营商开户了的，然后这些开户信息是储存在核心网络的，所以UE需要去到核心网去做认证因此SRB2就需要】

RRC Status
----------
-> RRC_CONNECTED & RRC_IDLE used in LTE and RRC_INACTIVE has been introduced to speed up transition to RRC_CONNECTED
1. RRC_CONNECTED
	-> A UE in this state has an RRC connection with a gNodeB.
2. RRC_IDLE [没有接入任何网络]
	-> A UE in this state does not have an RRC connection with a gNodeB.
3. RRC_INACTIVE
	-> A UE in this state suspends data processing but the gNodeB retains UE context information.

|SA Mobility Management |
=========================
-> mobility management involves intra-RAT and inter-RAT mobility management
-> 


==========================
|NSA Mobility Management |
==========================
-> TWO RRC satet involved in NSA networking: NSA RRC_CONNECTED & NSA RRC_IDLE
	 -----------------------------------------------
	 |Why is the RRC_INACTIVE state not supported? |
	 -----------------------------------------------
	  -> because relevant standards are undefined and the industry is immature.
		Option 3: EPC is used as the core network and no RRC_INACTIVE standards are defined for the EPC
		Option 7: Most vendors' eNodeBs, including Huawei's, are not well adapted to the RRC_INACTIVE state
		Option 4: 5G is not yet that mature in the current early stage of 5G deployment, and this networking is not used on the live network. 
			  RRC_INACTIVE is generally not discussed.

============================
|Overall Handover Mechanism|
============================
-> The same handover mechanism is shared between SA networking and NSA networking with the only difference lying in the signaling procedures in each phase of a handover process.
Process of handover:
	1. The gNodeB decides whether to start a handover process
		-> After an RRC connection is set up between a UE and a gNodeB, the gNodeB delivers related measurement configurations to the UE.
		-> When the gNodeB detects a qualified target cell based on the measurement report from the UE, the gNodeB instructs the UE to execute a handover.
		
		Two main factors kickstart handover start decision:
		  -> the handover function has been enabled
		  -> signal quality of the serving cell meets certain requirements.[Event 1(signal>threshold) & Event 2(signal<threshold)]
		
		Two processing mode for handover:-
		1. Measurement-based mode: UE measures the signal quality and report the results to gNodeB, 
					   gNodeB then uses the measurement report to generate a target cell list.

		2. Blind mode: The gNodeB generates a target cell or frequency list based on priority parameter configurations without instructing UEs 
				to measure the signal quality of candidate target cells.
		Eg:- When UE moves at high speed and UE moved out of the source cell before measurement completed, then it will increasing the service drop rate.
		      To prevent this, blind mode can be used to quickly implement a handover for the UE.

	2. The gNodeB sends measurement configurations to the UE through an RRCReconfiguration message.
		-> Measurement objects
			- objects on which UEs perform measurement, including SSB frequency, SSB SCS, SMTC, whitelisted cells, and blacklisted cells.
		-> Measurement gaps
			- a time period during which a UE performs measurement on non-serving frequencies. 
			  It is involved only in inter-frequency and inter-RAT measurements.
		-> Reporting configurations
			- consists the criteria for triggering measurement reporting and the format of a measurement report.
		----------------------------------------------------------------------------
		A1: (signal serving > threshold = stop handover) 
		    The signal quality of the serving cell exceeds a specific threshold.
		A2: (signal serving < threshold = start handover) 
		    The signal quality of the serving cell drops below a specific threshold.

		A3: (signal neighboring > signal serving = handover execution: s->n) 
		    The signal quality of a neighboring cell is higher than that of the serving cell by a certain offset.
		A4: (signal neighboring > threhold = handover execution: s->n) 
		    The signal quality of a neighboring cell exceeds a specific threshold.
		A5: (signal serving < threshold 1 && signal neighboring > threshold 2 = handover execution: s->n) 
		    The signal quality of the serving cell drops below threshold 1 and the signal quality of a neighboring cell exceeds threshold 2.
		A6: (neighboring cell > Secondary cell = handover execution: s->n) 
		    The signal quality of a neighboring cell is higher than that of the secondary cell by a certain offset.
		B1: (Neighbouring cell > Serving cell = handover execution: s->n) 
		    The signal quality of an inter-RAT neighboring cell exceeds a specific threshold.
		B2: (Serving cell < Threshold 1 && Neighbour cell > Threshold 2 = handover execution: s->n) 
		    The signal quality of the serving cell drops below threshold 1 and the signal quality of an inter-RAT neighboring cell exceeds threshold 2.


		-> Triggering quantity
			- Triggering quantity refers to the policy that triggers event reporting.

			RSRP(reference signal received power): indicates the strength of the received reference signals.
			RSSI(received signal strength indication): indicates the total signal strength of the current channel.
			RSRQ(reference signal received quality): indicates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and interference level of the current channel and is similar to the result of RSRP/RSSI.
			SINR(signal to interference plus noise ratio): indicates the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of the current channel and is an important indicator for measuring UE performance.
		-> Measurement IDs
			- A measurement ID links a measurement object with a reporting configurations as a set. 

	3. The UE performs measurement based on measurement configurations and then generates cell measurement results.	

	4. The UE reports the measurement results to the gNodeB through a measurement report.

	5. The gNodeB decides whether a new serving cell is suitable based on the measurement report.

	6. The gNodeB finds a suitable new serving cell and instructs the UE to execute a handover.

Handover Signaling Procedures
========================-----
1. SA networking
	-> handovers are classified into:- 
		- intra-base station handovers
		- Xn-based inter-base station handovers
		- NG-based inter-base station handovers

1.1 intra-base station handovers
	-> This handover is occurs between the cell is same base station.
	-> Measurement Phase:
		https://www.techtrained.com/centralized-unit-distributed-unit-cu-du-split-base-station-5g-systems-base-station-architecture/#:~:text=inter-gNodeB%20DU%20is%20responsible%20for%20allocating%20C-RNTI%20to,plane%20Signalling%20and%20User%20Plane%20Data%20in%20CU-DU
		# gNodeB-CU(Central Unit): handles higher-layer processing[RRC, SDAP, PDCP] and control function
		# gNodeB-DU(Distribute Unit): PLC, MAC, PHY
					      responsible for allocating C-RNTI（Cell Radio-Network Temporary Identifier） to a UE during Random Access
		# Both connnected ny F1 and F1AP is used to transmitted configuration information of radio bearers between the CU and DUs
		1. The gNodeB-CU sends an RRCReconfiguration message to the UE
		2. The UE sends an RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the gNodeB-CU.
		3. The UE sends a neighboring cell measurement report to the gNodeB-CU.
	-> Decision Phase:
		4. Based on the PCI in the measurement report, the gNodeB-CU determines that the target cell and the serving cell are served by the same gNodeB, 
		   and initiates an intra-base station handover
	-> Execution Handover:
发setup		5. The gNodeB-CU sends a UE CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message to the gNodeB-DU to request new UE resources for the target cell.
回复可以setup	6. The gNodeB-DU successfully allocates resources and sends a UE CONTEXT SETUP RESPONSE message to the gNodeB-CU.
发modification	7. The gNodeB-CU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION REQUEST message to the gNodeB-DU to signal an indication of stopping L2 scheduling in the source cell.
回复modified了	8. The gNodeB-DU sends a UE CONTEXT MODIFICATION RESPONSE message to the gNodeB-CU.
		9. The gNodeB-CU sends an RRCReconfiguration message to the UE to indicate the target frequency for handover, PCI(physical cell identifier), C-RNTI
			# C-RNTI: used for identifying and distinguishing a UE within a cell for radio communication, allow to track UE, 
		10. The UE initiates a non-contention-based random access to the target cell by sending MSG1
		11. The gNodeB-DU replies with MSG2.
		12. The UE sends an RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the gNodeB-CU and access the target cell.
		13. The gNodeB-CU sends a UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message to the gNodeB-DU then the source cell releases the UE which has been handed over to the target cell.
		14. The gNodeB-CU sends an RRCReconfiguration message that includes measurement configurations of the target cell to the UE after the UE is handed over to the target cell.
		15. The UE sends an RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the gNodeB-CU after receiving new measurement configurations.
	#same process for inter-base but got source DU and target DU
 
1.2 Xn-based inter-base station handovers
	Xn is the interface between two base station, so this handover will be include two gNodeB and include AMF
	-> Measurement Phase:	
		1. The source gNodeB will send RRCReconfiguration message to the UE to deliver measurement configurations include measurement object, measurement reporting con
		2. The UE sends an RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the source gNodeB.
		3. The UE performs measurement based on the received measurement configurations. The UE sends a measurement report to the source gNodeB when event conditions are met.
	-> Decision Phase:
		4. The source gNodeB selects a handover policy and the target cell/frequency based on the received measurement report.
		   gNodeB会根据报告来选policy和target cell	
	-> Execution Handover:
		5. If need handover,  source gNodeB sends a HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target gNodeB serving the selected target cell over the Xn interface to initiate a handover request
		 	如果决定要handover然后就会发送handover request给target gnodeB
		6. The target gNodeB applies admission control after receiving the handover request，then allocates a UE instance and transmission resources.
			之后targetB 会applied admission control以便是符合UE的
		7. The target gNodeB sends a HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the source gNodeB, indicating that the incoming handover is allowed.
			tagetB会发acknowledge告诉sourceB它同意handover
		8. The source gNodeB sends an RRCReconfiguration message to the UE, instructing the UE to execute a handover to the target cell.
			sourceB会指示UE执行handover去targetB
		9. UE initiates a non-contention-based random access (for transmited their initial access request) to the target cell served by the target gNodeB by sending MSG1
			UE 通过发送随机接入向targetB的cell
		10. The target gNodeB replies with MSG2 to UE.
			targetB回复ok
		11. The UE sends an RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the target gNodeB to indicate handover air interface is completed
			URE回复complete mssg 来说明handover ok了
		12. The target gNodeB sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to the AMF to notify the serving cell is changed. [The message include target cell ID and list of switched PDU session]
			告诉AMF，UE已经更改了cell；list of switched PDU session is to ensure continuity of the communication messages. 
		13. The AMF sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to the target gNodeB.
			AMF告诉targetB，他已经知道了
		14. The target gNodeB sends a UE CONTEXT RELEASE message to the source gNodeB.
			targetB通知sourceB把UE的context release了
		15. The gNodeB sends an RRCReconfiguration message that includes measurement configurations of the target cell to the UE after the UE is handed over to the target cell.
		16. The UE sends an RRCReconfigurationComplete message to the gNodeB after receiving new measurement configurations.
1.3 Ng-based handovers
	-> Ng is between base station and 5GC/AMF
	-> Measurement Phase:	
		1. 
		2. 
		3. 

	-> Decision Phase:

	-> Execution Phase:


2. NSA networking
	-> five scenarios are involved:-	
		- SgNB addition
			-> UE connects to eNB but come to 5G NR coverage, and the gNB can be added to the connection
			-> This is to ensure the UE can access 5G NR seervices while still maintaning its LTE connection.
		- SgNB modification
			-> A process for existing connection involved secondary gNB are modified
			case: When UE is moving to another 5G cell and exceed the serving 5G cell so report event A3 to do modification
		- MeNB handover
			-> A process in 5G when UE is handover from one Master eNB to another [can be intra(same eNB,different cell) / inter(different eNB and the cell from different eNB)]
		- SgNB change
			-> A process for switching from one Secondary gNB to another gNB
		- SgNB release
			-> A procedure in 5G when the connection between UE and secondary gNB is terminated.
			case: the UE is ready to out from the coverage of 5G.
============================================
|Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover|[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9763399]
============================================
-> DAPS is proposed as a mobility enhancement solution
-> During DAPS handover execution, the UE retains its user-plane connection with the source cell for data transmission with the source cell until a connection is set up between the UE and the target cell.
	-> DAPS let UE  exchange data with the source and target cells simultaneously within a short period of time
	-> The UE continues receiving downlink user data from the source cell until the source cell is released.
	-> The UE continues transmitting uplink user data to the source cell until it succeeds in random access in the target cell.

============================
|Conditional HandOver (CHO)|
============================
-> an enhancement to basic NR handovers to reduce handover failures in the preceding cases.
-> some failure condition:-
	-> The measurement report from the UE cannot reach the base station.
	-> After receiving a measurement report, the HO command cannot be sent to UE.
-> HOW?
	-> With CHO, the source base station can delivers a HO command to UE before the radio environment between UE and sourceB going to worst.
	->
